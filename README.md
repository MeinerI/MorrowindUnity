# MorrowindUnity
Unity implementation of TES III: Morrowind engine

This project does not contain any code or assets from the game itself. It requires a valid Steam installation to be present on your PC. Currently it only searches in the default Steam installation on the C: drive.

It requires Unity 2019.3.0f6 or later.

I based this project on a similar Github project a few years ago. It was called TES-Unity, however I can't seem to find it anymore. It provided a great starting point, however almost, if not all of the code has been re-written from scratch for my own learning purposes.

I began this project a few years ago when learning about Unity and Game Development. Over time I have added quite a few features from the original game. It is still missing quite a few things such as combat, magic, load/save, journal, etc.

However you can travel most of the world, interact with NPC's, enter interiors, travel using silt striders, and equip items. It also has realtime shadows, and supports Unity's built-in post processing. (Requires enabling the post processing layer on the camera)

Getting Started: Ensure Morrowind is installed in the default directory on the C drive, Download the repo, Open in Unity, open the "World" scene and click play.

Controls: WSAD: Move U: Unlock doors Tab: Open Inventory

Left Mouse: Open doors, pickup items, equip/unequip items in inventory, talk to NPCs
